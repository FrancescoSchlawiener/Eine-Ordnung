Position Statement – Research Scope, Legal Context, and Conceptual Independence
1. Nature of This Work – Conceptual and Theoretical Research

This repository represents purely theoretical and conceptual research.
It contains ideas, models, frameworks, and hypotheses about language, consciousness, resonance, self-organization, and systemic processes.
The goal of this work is to advance fundamental understanding – not to develop specific technologies, devices, or commercial products.

Key characteristics of this research:

🧠 It is conceptual and theoretical – dealing with ideas, principles, and models, not with technical implementations.

📚 It belongs to the tradition of systemic and cybernetic research as developed by Heinz von Foerster, Humberto Maturana, Francisco Varela, Gregory Bateson, Niklas Luhmann, and others.

🔄 It describes emergent, self-referential, and field-based processes rather than linear mechanisms.

🌍 It aims to remain free, open, and accessible to all, in the spirit of collective scientific progress.

2. Patent Law Context – Why This Work Is Not Patentable

According to established principles of international patent law:

❌ Ideas, theories, and conceptual models are not patentable.

✅ Only specific, concrete technical implementations – such as devices, algorithms, or engineered processes – may qualify for patent protection.

📜 Theoretical work remains free to study, discuss, share, and evolve, regardless of any future patents on specific implementations.

This means:

The concepts in this repository cannot be restricted, owned, or monopolized.

Anyone is free to study, critique, extend, or reinterpret them under the terms of the Creative Commons BY-NC 4.0 License.

Even if future inventions build on these ideas, those inventions will be separate works and will not alter the free nature of the underlying research.

3. Public Disclosure – Prior Art Protection

This research has been publicly released and is openly accessible under a Creative Commons BY-NC 4.0 license.
This public disclosure means:

🛡️ The ideas and models described here are now prior art.

🧪 Any future attempt to patent these ideas themselves would fail the novelty requirement under patent law.

⚖️ The open publication serves as legal evidence of their existence and public availability.

4. Relationship to CLF (Causal Language Framework)

A number of conceptual discussions have taken place in parallel with a project called CLF (Causal Language Framework). It is important to clarify:

CLF, in its current form, is a conceptual, narrative framework, not a technical system.

It does not contain implementable algorithms, mathematical formalism, or specific engineering processes.

It is not patentable as it stands and operates on a metaphorical level – closer to poetic semantics than to applied science.

The work in this repository:

🧬 Operates on a different scientific level, describing field dynamics, emergent meaning, and systemic self-organization.

🌐 Is independent of CLF and does not derive from it.

📚 Stands as a separate body of theoretical research with its own lineage, foundations, and scope.

Even if conceptual parallels exist (as they naturally do in scientific discourse), such parallels do not create legal or intellectual property dependencies.
Theories and frameworks cannot be monopolized and remain part of the open domain of knowledge.

5. Future Applications – Clear Separation of Domains

If, in the future, someone develops a technical application based on ideas found here, that work will be treated as an independent invention.
Such applications:

May be patentable in their own right if they meet legal requirements (novelty, inventive step, industrial applicability).

Will not restrict the free use, study, or discussion of the underlying theories in this repository.

Must acknowledge prior art and the open conceptual foundation provided here.

6. Statement of Intent

The purpose of this research is not ownership or control but open exploration and collective advancement of knowledge.
This work is offered freely to the scientific and philosophical community, in the belief that understanding grows through collaboration, dialogue, and open inquiry.

“We stand on the shoulders of those before us, and what we discover belongs not to us alone, but to all who seek to understand.” – Adapted from Newton

📑 Legal Summary

All contents of this repository are conceptual research and not patentable in themselves.

They are released under Creative Commons BY-NC 4.0 and may be freely used, studied, and expanded for non-commercial purposes.

Their public disclosure constitutes prior art, preventing exclusive patent claims on the ideas themselves.

Any future technical implementations derived from these concepts are independent works and do not affect the free nature of this research.

No claim of ownership or control is asserted over knowledge itself.
